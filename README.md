## :clipboard:**Introduction**

    I made the "Cool Trivia Science Computer Science" quiz because I love science, and the science I know the least about is CS.
    Being part of the Philosophy Club at the university I understand the value of questions.  I made this application using a Trivia API.
    It's a fairly simple application produced with the emphasis on learning new technologies( TypeScript + Material-UI ) 
    and applying the skills that I've required in the past few months.
  
##  **Goals of this project**

 1. The main goal of this project is to gain experience in developing a full-stack app and learn new technologies.

        note: The app is not fully responsive and styling is not final. 
        A new scoring system and category picker will be added in the new update.

### Objectives 
   - Practical applications of learned skills: 
         
         ReactJS, Node(ES6), Redux, REST,  
   
   - Implementation of new technologies.
      1. TypeScript
      2. Material-UI
   - Creating user stories, database models, and wireframes.
   - Practice with version control - branching and pull requests.
  
  
###### Objectives that I did good. 
   1. Successfully implemented part of the required skills.
   2. A functional TypeScript app with Material-UI styling.
   
   
###### Objectives that I could do better 
   1. The git hub commits and pull requests went bad. 
   There is a lot to improve, but thankfully during my team-project, I had the opportunity to make do it better.
   Communication is a key for me so I will be doing GitHub courses.

## **Setup**
#### Server setup
- clone the repository
- cd into the project directory
- on first run, run the script npm run initialize, this will run npm i && npm run resetDB && npm run start
afterward, simply run npm run start which will run the script npx nodemon index.js or node index.js
the server runs on port 4000 by default.


#### Client setup

- clone the repository
- cd into the project directory
- on the first run, run the script npm run initialize, this will run npm install && react-scripts star
- afterward, the first run just run the script npm run start to start development
- the client runs on localhost:3000 by default
)
