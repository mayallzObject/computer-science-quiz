### Introduction
Hi, my name is Ivaylo, and this is my 1sr portfolio project.
The Cool Trivia web application is in MVP status, with the plan of adding more functionality and styling. 


### Goals of this project
The main goal of this project is to gain experience developing a full-stack app and learn new Technologies. 
My idea was to have one day of research in TypeScript and Material-UI then adjust on the fly.
The front end was made with React, Redux and Material-UI.

#### Objectives 
   - Practical applications of learned skills.
   - Implementation of new technologies.
   - Creating user stories, database models and wireframes.
   - Practice with version control - branching and pull requests.
  
  
 #### Objectives that I did good. 
   1. Succeslly implemetned part of the required skills.
   2. A functional TypeScript app with Material-UI styling.
   
   
 #### Objectives that I could do better 
   1. The git hub commits and pull requests went pretty bad.
   There is a lot to improve ,but thankfully during my team-project I had the opportunity to make do it better.
   
#### Server setup
- clone the repository; 
- cd into the project directory
- on first run, run the script npm run initialize, this will run npm i && npm run resetDB && npm run start;
afterwards simply run npm run start which will run the script npx nodemon index.js or node index.js
server runs on port 4000 by default.


#### Client setup

- clone the repository;
- cd into the project directory;
- on first run, run the script npm run initialize, this will run npm install && react-scripts start;
- afterwards first run just run the script npm run start to start development;
- client runs on localhost:3000 by default;
