## **Introduction**
Hello! My name is Ivaylo, and this is my 1st portfolio project.
I made this portfolio project because I like to learn in a fun way. Being part of the Philosophy club in University 
I learned the value of questions.    
The Cool Trivia web application is in MVP status, with the plan of adding more functionality and styling.
It's a fairly simple application made with the emphasis on learning new technologies and applying the skils thatI required in the past 
few months.


##  **Goals of this project**
The main goal of this project is to gain experience developing a full-stack app and learn new Technologies. 
My idea was to have one day of research in TypeScript and Material-UI then adjust on the fly.
The front end was made with React, Redux and Material-UI.
The app is fully responsive but styling is not final. 
New scoring system and category picker, will be added in the new feature

### Objectives 
   - Practical applications of learned skills: react, redux, REST, 
   - Implementation of new technologies.
   - Creating user stories, database models and wireframes.
   - Practice with version control - branching and pull requests.
  
  
###### Objectives that I did good. 
   1. Succeslly implemetned part of the required skills.
   2. A functional TypeScript app with Material-UI styling.
   
   
###### Objectives that I could do better 
   1. The git hub commits and pull requests went pretty bad.
   There is a lot to improve ,but thankfully during my team-project I had the opportunity to make do it better.

## **Setup**
#### Server setup
- clone the repository; 
- cd into the project directory
- on first run, run the script npm run initialize, this will run npm i && npm run resetDB && npm run start;
afterwards simply run npm run start which will run the script npx nodemon index.js or node index.js
server runs on port 4000 by default.


#### Client setup

- clone the repository;
- cd into the project directory;
- on first run, run the script npm run initialize, this will run npm install && react-scripts start;
- afterwards first run just run the script npm run start to start development;
- client runs on localhost:3000 by default;
