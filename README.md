## :clipboard: Introduction
        I made the "Computer Science Quiz Front" quiz because I love science,
        and the science I know the least about is CS.
        Being part of the Philosophy Club at the university I understand the value of questions.  
        It's a fairly simple application produced with the emphasis on 
        learning new technologies( TypeScript + Material-UI ) 
        and applying the skills that I've required in the past few months.
  
## :mortar_board: Goals of this project

 1. The main goal of this project is to gain experience in developing a full-stack app and learn new technologies
        
        note: The app is not fully responsive and styling is not final. 
        A new scoring system and category picker will be added in the new update.

##  :pencil2: Objectives 
   
        1. Practical applications of learned skills: 
        ReactJS | Node(ES6) | Redux | REST  
   
        2. Implementation of new technologies:
        TypeScript | Material-UI
   
       3. Planning: 
       User Stories | Database Diagrams wireframes
   
       4. Practice with version control: 
       Atomic Commits | Branching | Good Commit Masseges  
  
  
###### :heavy_check_mark: Objectives that I did good. 
     
        Successfully implemented part of the required skills.
        A functional TypeScript app with Material-UI styling.
   
   
###### :x: Objectives that I could do better 
     
        Commit masseges and atomic commits were not implamentet correctly.
        Due to time restrictions, bad planning and inexperience I did not do a good job
        
        Communication is a key for me. I am curretly doing advanced GitHub courses.
        Instead of starting the project from scratch. I decided to leave it like this
        and improve on my new project. It's was good lesson to learn. 

## :octocat: Setup
**Server setup**
    
        clone the repository
        cd into the project directory
        on first run, run the script npm run initialize, this will run npm i && npm run resetDB && npm run start
        afterward, simply run npm run start which will run the script npx nodemon index.js or node index.js
        the server runs on port 4000 by default.


**Client setup**

        clone the repository
        cd into the project directory
        on the first run, run the script npm run initialize, this will run npm install && react-scripts 
        star afterward, the first run just run the script npm run start to start development
        the client runs on localhost:3000 by default
